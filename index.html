            Our game is a chess playing field, which includes the playing pieces for it. The game can only be played
            from one desktop computer.
            It continues until one of the two players defeats the other. Also in our game there are instructions on
            which figure can move where.
            The game can be played by two friends, for example, to compete with each other.

            Until the making of our game, there were several stages that we had to deal with.
            The first stage we had to go through was the one, we had to choose what game we were going to do.
            Once we decided to do chess, the first thing we decided to do was to make the playing field. Then step by
            step
            we started making the movements of the different types of figures that we have in the chess and the
            animations that show you which figure you can walk with.
